# rrw-image-pdf-download
React Redux App which shows list of images &amp; pdfs and gives options to download it.  


## Used my own boilerplate for the setup : 'react-redux-webpack-boilerplate'; 
## Versions used:
### React and ReactDom - 16.4.1
### Redux - 4.0.0
### React Router - 4.3.1
### Webpack and Webpack dev server - 3.10.0 and 2.11.1 (respectively)


## To run it in local:
### Clone the repo, "npm i" in root and then "npm start" will create the bundle

### npm run build (dist folder will be created; deploy that folder in the web server)
